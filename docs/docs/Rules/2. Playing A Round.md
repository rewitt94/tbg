A round is a repeating structure to the game. The game consists of a indefinite amount of rounds until the win conditions are met. Full round consists of the following phases:

------------------------------

For the round each playable phase is started with the player with the starter chip. Play is cycles to left (do not pass the starter chip) and once all players have player the phase then the next phase starts.

During playable phases players cannot interact with eachothers gamestate.

5. Passive phase
6. Buy phase
